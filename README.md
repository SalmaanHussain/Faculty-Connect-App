\# Faculty Connect App – Virtual Reception System



\## Project Overview

This repository contains the \*\*Faculty Connect Application\*\*, developed as part of a \*\*group-based Virtual Reception System\*\* for the EECE foyer. The overall system was designed to assist visitors by providing automated interaction, staff availability, and communication routing.



This repository specifically showcases \*\*Subsystem 4 – Faculty Connect App\*\*, which was my individual responsibility within the group project.

\## My Role \& Contribution

\*\*Subsystem 4: Faculty Connect Application (Individual Responsibility)\*\*



I was responsible for the \*\*design, implementation, and integration\*\* of the Faculty Connect App, a desktop-based application that enables communication between visitors and faculty members through the virtual receptionist system.



My responsibilities included:

\- Designing the subsystem architecture and interfaces

\- Implementing lecturer availability and status handling

\- Developing call initiation and termination logic

\- Implementing network communication with the backend server

\- Ensuring compatibility with the overall system design



---



\## Subsystem Description

The Faculty Connect App functions as the \*\*communication interface for lecturers\*\*, allowing them to:

\- Log into the system securely

\- Set and update their availability status

\- Receive incoming call requests from visitors

\- Accept or reject calls

\- Terminate active calls gracefully



The application communicates with a backend server to exchange real-time call and status information using structured messages.

\## Technologies Used

\- \*\*Language:\*\* C#

\- \*\*Framework:\*\* .NET (Windows Desktop Application)

\- \*\*UI Framework:\*\* WinForms / WPF

\- \*\*Networking:\*\* Socket-based communication

\- \*\*Backend Integration:\*\* Flask server (JSON message exchange)

\- \*\*Development Tools:\*\* Visual Studio

\- \*\*Version Control:\*\* Git \& GitHub



---



\## System Integration

The Faculty Connect App integrates with:

\- The \*\*Virtual Reception Interface\*\*

\- The \*\*Backend Communication Server\*\*

\- Other subsystems developed by group members



The app was designed according to predefined interface specifications to ensure seamless subsystem interoperability.

\## Key Features

\- Lecturer authentication and session handling

\- Availability status management

\- Incoming call notifications

\- Call acceptance, rejection, and termination

\- Structured JSON-based communication

\- Modular and maintainable code structure

\## Project Context

This project was completed as part of a \*\*Computer Engineering design module\*\* and followed a structured engineering design process including:

\- Requirements analysis

\- Subsystem decomposition

\- Interface specification

\- Implementation and testing

\- System-level integration
